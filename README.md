**Project Description/Summary:**

Creating a Node.js application that dynamically generates a site after receiving user input via the terminal.

---

**Live Site:**

As this is a site built with Node.js inputs - there is no live site. Please see the "Installation" section.

---

**Technology Used:**

- JavaScript
- Markdown
- Node.js

---

**Installation:**

In order to install this application, you will need Node.js on your local computer and have this repo cloned. Once you have that installed properly, you will need to open a terminal - either through VSCode or GitBash and input the command "node index.js". This will trigger a series of user prompts that you will need to complete. The ones that are marked "Required" will require an input and cannot be skipped.
